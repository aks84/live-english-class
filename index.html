              <strong>Do I need a computer to attend the classes?</strong>
              </summary>
              <p>
                It's good to have a computer or laptop with reliable internet
                connection, but a tablet or a good smartphone will alos do the
                job.
              </p>
              </details>
              <details>
              <summary><strong>Will classes be held everyday?</strong></summary>
              <p>
                It depends on how many classes you have booked. It's good idea to talk to your tutor and aks if they can offer you daily class. If you are a working person; I would suggest make it on alternate days.
              </p>
              </details>

              <summary><strong>What if I miss any class?</strong></summary>
              <p>
                If you cannot attend a class for some reason, you'll have to
                inform me prior the class day to save my time.
